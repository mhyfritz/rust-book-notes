# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

Rust's _module system_ consists of:

- **Packages**: Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- **Crates**: tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- **Modules** and **use**: features for controlling organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- **Paths**: way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module
